The WebDriver layer:
The WebDriver layer is ideally located in the src/main/java folder, which
is considered a good programming practice. To ensure its maintainability,
it's recommended to organize this layer into three distinct classes:
DriverFactory, DriverManager, and Driver. This modular approach promotes
better code management.

The DriverFactory class manages the configuration of various drivers such as
Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others.
The DriverManager class supervises driver instances using ThreadLocal.
ThreadLocal allows the creation of variables that are accessible exclusively
within the same thread, the safeguarding of parallel testing.

Lastly, the Driver class consists of two core methods: one for initializing
the browser and another for closing it. This separation of roles ensures a
clear and efficient handling of browser instances. By embracing these practices,
your WebDriver layer becomes well-organized and simpler to maintain, leading
to effective and robust test automation.

Title: Structured Page Object Design Using Java Composition

Introduction:
In software testing and test automation, one essential aspect is maintaining a
clear and efficient structure for organizing page objects. These page objects
represent the different pages and components of an application. A well-structured
design not only enhances readability but also improves maintainability and reusability.
One approach to achieving this is through Java composition principles.

1. Page Layer Organization:=====
All pages will reside in the src/main/java directory within a single
folder. Each page object will encapsulate its locators and related methods. The goal
here is to keep things focused and modular, making the codebase more manageable.

2. Locator-Methods Pairing:
Each page object will contain its locators, and for almost every locator, there will
be a corresponding method. This approach ensures that there's a clear relationship
between the locators and their usage methods. This makes the code more intuitive
to understand.

3. Method Chaining for Readability:
To enhance code readability, a chaining approach can be used. Each method will
return the current page object instance, allowing for a fluent and easily
understandable flow. For instance, if we consider a LoginPage, methods for
interacting with the username field, password field, and submit button will
return the LoginPage object. When the submit button is clicked, and the page
redirects to the HomePage, the submit method can return an instance of the HomePage.

4. Components and Composition:
Many pages might share common components like a top menu, side panel, or footer.
To avoid redundancy and maintain a consistent design, separate page objects can
be created for these components, like TopMenuPage, SidePanelPage, and FooterPage.

5. Java Composition Principle:
The concept of composition in Java allows us to create complex objects by combining
simpler objects. In this case, we'll apply composition by initializing component
pages within the main page objects' constructors. This eliminates the need to create
a multitude of pages and simplifies the overall structure.

Conclusion:
A well-structured page object design is crucial for efficient test automation.
Using Java composition principles, we can achieve a modular and maintainable framework.
This approach organizes page objects, their locators, and methods in a clear manner.
The chaining technique enhances code readability, and the use of composition minimizes
redundancy by encapsulating shared components. This design approach ultimately results
in a more organized, maintainable, and efficient test automation framework.
